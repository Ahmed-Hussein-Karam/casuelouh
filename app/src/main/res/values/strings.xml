    <!--  prompts  -->
    <string name="outfit_prompt">Suppose that a piece of clothing is characterized by the following properties:
- type: string, a valid piece of clothes(e.g. t-shirt, shoes, sunglasses, skirt, Jacket, … etc).
    - coloring: string, describe the coloring of this element (e.g. red, blue with white spots, … etc).
    - gender: string, (e.g. Men, Unisex, Girls, … etc).
    - usage: string, (e.g. casual, formal, smart casual, sport, … etc).
    - pattern: string, (e.g. plain, floral, striped, gradient, … etc).


In the attached image, you see some piece of clothing. Try to detect its properties. If you are unsure about some property, just give your best guess with no extra reasoning or explanation.

In a json object, recommend two things (outfit and hot prompts)

Outfit (json array):
an outfit based on this piece of clothes in the image, such that:
* Each element in the json array is an object that represents an element that is part of the outfit.
* Each element in the array is an object with the properties described above.
* Elements of the array shape together a consistent elegant outfit that you recommend based on one input item I give you.
* The item in the image should be part of the outfit you give me.

Hot prompts (json array):
According to the outfit you recommend, provide the user with 2 or 3 prompt suggestions that the user is likely to ask for some modifications on the outfit. Here are some example ideas of hot prompts:
* Remove sunglasses
* Change shirt style
* Add a jacket
Note that a hot prompt should be between 2 and 5 words and should be relevant to the outfit you already recommended.


Your response should be valid json string without any extra text, greeting or explanation.

Output json format:
{
"outfit": array of clothing pieces,
"hotPrompts": array of hot prompt strings
}
a clothing piece is an object with the format {"type": .., "coloring": .., "gender": .., "usage": .., "pattern": ..}

Corner cases:
- if more than one piece of clothing appear in the image, just pick one of them and work on it.
- if you see no clothes in the image, return empty json arrays like this: {"outfit": [], "hotPrompts": []}
    </string>

    <string name="hot_prompt">Given the following json array: %1$s
Apply the hot prompt %2$s on "outfit" sub-array, and then re-update the "hotPrompts" sub-array based on the final "outfit".
return the updated json so that your response should be valid json string without any extra text, greeting or explanation.
